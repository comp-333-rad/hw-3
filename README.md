musicdb app with react as frontend and django as backend


Roshaan worked mostly on the frontend, Daniel did the backend, as well as the authentication and react login form.

### Rating Scheme

We chose to use a rating scheme where each user can see the average rating of each song, and then can also edit their own rating for any song.

### Installation:

Just install Django and Npm as you usually do. 

##### Django
Then, go into `musicdb-app/Backend-django` and activate the `django_song_service_virtual_env` and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages. Then run `python3 manage.py runserver`
##### React
Then go into `musicdb-app/Frontend-react` and run `npm i` to install all node packages. After that is done, run npm start to start the backend servor.

### running

Simply go to localhost:3000 and follow the instructions to register/login, and then go and play around with the various functionality!
